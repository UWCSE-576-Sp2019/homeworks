# Welcome to CSE 576 (Computer Vision) Spring 2019!

In this repository you will play with different computer vision applications. The code is written in C++ and we will use the Qt platform to run the code with a GUI interface. Please read the word document QtInstallation.docx to install and use Qt. Pay careful attention to all the instructions.

To get started, make sure you have `git` installed. Then run:
